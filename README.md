# `dotfiles-public`

- ⚙️ Configuration files to have the same environment wherever I go
- 🐧 I use Arch BTW
- ⚠️ By design, there are no backups! Don't edit file locally. Always push.

## The setup

This configuration is made for an environment with the following:

- alacritty
- neovim
- i3
- zsh
- git

## Installation

- clone the repo
- run `install.sh`
